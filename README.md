# My_portfolio_project
I created a personal portfolio website using HTML and CSS to showcase my skills, projects, and contact details in a professional and responsive layout. The website serves as my digital resume and highlights my design sense and coding abilities.
Key Features:

Responsive Design: Works smoothly on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

Clean UI/UX: Simple, modern, and easy-to-navigate interface.

Sections Included: Home, About Me, Projects, and Contact.

Sticky Navigation Bar: Allows smooth scrolling between sections.

Interactive Buttons & Hover Effects: Adds a touch of interactivity using CSS transitions.

 Technologies Used:

HTML5: For creating the structure and layout.

CSS3: For styling, animations, and responsive design.

Learning Outcome / What I Gained:

Improved understanding of HTML structure and semantic tags.

Gained experience with CSS layouts (Flexbox, Grid).

Learned how to make a fully responsive website.

Enhanced design thinking and UI/UX principles.
